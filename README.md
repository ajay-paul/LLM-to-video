# LLM-Powered Video Explanation Generator
An LLM-driven system that generates video explanations for user queries, focusing on STEM subjects. Unlike traditional text-to-video systems that rely on heavy visual generation pipelines, our text-based architecture produces long, concept-rich 'videos' at a fraction of the time and cost. This enables deep, high-quality STEM learning on demand, making complex topics accessible to anyone, anywhere, like having a personal tutor on demand.
